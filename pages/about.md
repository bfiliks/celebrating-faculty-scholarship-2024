## Celebration of Faculty Scholarship 2024

The University Libraries faculty and staff are very grateful to everyone who submitted publications for this year's celebration. As an extension of the annual gathering we hosted in the Loyola Information Commons,we are pleased to have an opportunity to promote and celebrate the work of Loyola faculty.  We hope you will take this opportunity to explore and appreciate the faculty's hard work and creativity displayed here. We invite you to browse the exhibit by [title]( https://bfiliks.github.io/celebrating-faculty-scholarship-2024/browse.html) or [subjects](https://bfiliks.github.io/celebrating-faculty-scholarship-2024/subjects.html). You can also view all the [faculty participants](/faculty.html) and see their recent work on their research profile pages.

Be on the lookout for faculty features from this exhibit on the Libraries' social media. If you want to join in the conversation, please follow us @LUCLibraries on Facebook and Twitter, or @librariesLUC on Instagram.
