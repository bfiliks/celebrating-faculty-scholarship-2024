coll003,ballicora.jpg,,,A critical inter-subunit interaction for the transmission of the allosteric signal in the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase,Miguel A. Ballicora,Hiral P. Patel;  Gabriela Martinez‐Ramirez; Emily Dobrzynski,2023-08-08,Article,"ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is a key regulatory enzyme involved in starch and glycogen synthesis in plants and bacteria, respectively. It has been hypothesized that inter-subunit communications are important for the allosteric effect in this enzyme. However, no specific interactions have been identified as part of the regulatory signal. The enzyme from Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a homotetramer allosterically regulated by fructose 6-phosphate and pyruvate. Three pairs of distinct subunit-subunit interfaces are present. Here we focus on an interface that features two symmetrical interactions between Arg11 and Asp141 from one subunit with residues Asp141 and Arg11 of the neighbor subunit, respectively. Previously, scanning mutagenesis showed that a mutation at the Arg11 position disrupted the activation of the enzyme. Considering the distance of these residues from the allosteric and catalytic sites, we hypothesized that the interaction between Arg11 and Asp141 is critical for allosteric signaling rather than effector binding. To prove our hypothesis, we mutated those two sites (D141A, D141E, D141N, D141R, R11D, and R11K) and performed kinetic and binding analysis. Mutations that altered the charge affected the regulation the most. To prove that the interaction per se (rather than the presence of specific residues) is critical, we partially rescued the R11D protein by introducing a second mutation (R11D/D141R). This could not restore the activator effect on kcat, but it did rescue the effect on substrate affinity. Our results indicate the critical functional role of Arg11 and Asp141 to relay the allosteric signal in this subunit interface.",ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase;Allosteric regulation;Kinetics;Subunit interaction;Chemistry,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_pubmedcentral_primary_oai_pubmedcentral_nih_gov_10461462&context=PC&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISSN:  0961-8368,Wiley Online Library,"Patel, Hiral P., et al.

Bohanon,Ali Kushki,2023-11-28,Article,"Schools have an increased focus on implementing schoolwide initiatives (e.g., multi-tiered systems of support; MTSS) to address risk factors related to dropping out. These interventions can involve multiple domains, including academic, behavioural, and social and emotional supports. Although researchers suggest that schoolwide interventions are effective, school staff may need help implementing various content (e.g., academic, behaviour) domains into a cohesive plan. This preliminary study focused on nine schools in the Midwestern United States that implemented schoolwide interventions as part of a statewide technical assistance approach. The research included using survey and extant data for all students to determine the connections between schoolwide interventions, school improvement, and student outcomes. Schools in this study that were higher on both school improvement and MTSS implementation had, in general, better student outcomes associated with predictors of dropping out of school. These findings indicate that school improvement and MTSS may be mutually beneficial enterprises that help school staff address factors related to dropping out.",Multi-tiered systems of support;MTSS;Schoolwide interventions;Secondary schools,,,,https://ecommons.luc.edu/education_facpubs/190/,ISSN: 2515-0731,Cambridge University Press,"Bohanon, Hank; Wu, Meng-Jia; Kushki, Ali; and LeVesseur, Cheyne.

Bost,,2023-01-01,Book Chapter,"The contributors to Crip Genealogies reorient the field of disability studies by centering the work of transnational feminism, queer of color critique, and trans scholarship and activism. They challenge the white, Western, and Northern rights-based genealogy of disability studies, showing how a single coherent narrative of the field is a mode of exclusion that relies on logics of whiteness and imperialism. The contributors examine how disability justice activists work in concert with other social justice projects, explore crip environments, create alternate disciplinary genealogies, and reject notions of the model minority. Throughout, they demonstrate how the mandate for a single genealogy of the discipline whitewashes disability and continues forms of violence. By cripping disability studies, the contributors allow for divergent histories, the coexistence of anti-ableist and antiracist theorizing, and a radically just and capacious understanding of disability.

Cantwell,,2023-09-01,Article,"This article tracks the surprising history of a love ballad about a lost sweetheart that went on to become a celebrated gospel hymn about the rural roots of America's greatness. Titled ""The Little Brown Church,"" but sometimes called ""The Church in the Wildwood,"" the song's evolution speaks to the ways in which nostalgia became central to the social and religious imagination of those American Protestants call themselves ""evangelicals."" Though it first appeared in college songbooks after its publication in 1865, ""The Little Brown Church"" eventually became a favorite of evangelists, revivalists, and other gospel singers at the dawn of the twentieth century. For these new singers, ""The Little Brown Church"" spoke to more than just the simple faith they wished to restore. It also illustrated the centrality of white Protestants to the American experience at a moment when the hold these believers had on the nation was beginning to slip. And they would alter both the lyrics and the church's history to bring the two in line. The process not only reveals how nostalgia for a bygone era became vital to those who think of themselves as evangelicals in the twentieth century, but also how evangelicalism itself is something of a historical construction.",20th century;Sacred music;Church music;Nostalgia;Religion ,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_proquest_journals_2900121694&context=PC&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISSN: 0009-6407,Cambridge University Press,"Cantwell, Christopher D..

However, the packet metadata such as the packet size and number of packets can still be observed by an adversary. This is commonly known as fingerprinting and website fingerprinting attacks have received a lot of attention recently as a known victim’s website visits can be accurately predicted, deanonymizing that victim’s web usage. Most of the previous work have been performed in laboratory settings and have made two assumptions: 1) a victim visits one website at a time, and 2) the whole website visit with all the network packets can be observed. To validate these assumptions, a new private webbrowser extension called WebTracker is deployed with real users. WebTracker records the websites visited, when the website loading starts, and when the website loading finishes. Results show that users’ browsing patterns are different than what was previously assumed. Users may browse the web in a way that acts as a countermeasure against website fingerprinting due to multiple websites overlapping and downloading at the same time. Over 15% of websites overlap with at least one other website and each overlap was 66 seconds. Moreover, each overlap happens roughly 9 seconds after the first website download has started. Thus, this reinforces some previous work that the beginning of a website is more important than the end for a website fingerprinting attack.",Webbrowsing;Website fingerprinting;Anonymity;Privacy;Computer sciences,,,,https://ecommons.luc.edu/cs_facpubs/355/,ISBN: 979-8-3503-2157-9,IEEE,"""WebTracker: Real Webbrowsing Behaviors"", IEEE Silicon Valley Cybersecurity Conference (SVCC), May 2023",,record,eng,,

This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) delivered a novel adaptation of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for College Students (IPT-CS) in group modality at a college counseling center. Of 97 students expressing interest, 18 with mild to moderate depression were randomized to IPT-CS or referral-to-usual-care. The nine who initiated IPT-CS treatment had an average 96.67% attendance rate across 10 sessions and rated IPT-CS as satisfactory and accessible. Facilitators also rated IPT-CS as satisfactory, feasible, and faithful to IPT. Group-by-time analyses indicated that IPT-CS, compared to referral-to-usual-care, yielded a pattern of medium to large effects for depression, anxiety, quality of life, social adjustment and support, interpersonal concerns overall, and disconnection/loneliness specifically. As the pilot trial was powered to detect quite large effects, group-by-time analyses only reached statistical significance for depression and social support, as did within-group analyses for quality of life and interpersonal concerns overall. Importantly, reductions in depression and anxiety were clinically significant, dropping from moderate at pre-intervention to mild/no signs at post-intervention.

In video gaming, women have come to represent nearly half of the market; yet, this is a limited indicator of gender-based progress. A culture of masculine dominance persists. Extending previous research on boundary work, the authors employ a cultural perspective of tokenism to examine how gendered boundaries in consumption subcultures persist despite efforts to transform or even eradicate them. This qualitative study draws on interviews with 23 gamers who identify as women (ages 19–29 years), coupled with data from social media platforms, news media, and industry reports. Empirical findings capture the recursive process of maladaptive boundary crossing: how women’s efforts to subvert gendered boundaries at the micro level (e.g., through response enactments) get churned through the structuring tokenistic mechanics of boundary work at the meso level and result in the inadvertent cultural persistence of masculine dominance. The analysis offers a conceptual framework that explains how micro–meso level dynamics perpetuate and conceal inequity in consumption subcultures.

Working class candidates rarely emerge, but existing evidence suggests workers perform as well as white-collar candidates once on the ballot. However, this evidence comes from studies of general elections. It is unknown whether these findings extend to other types of elections like primaries, where candidates compete without the political and financial backing of a party. We collect and analyze novel data describing the occupational background of all candidates who competed in U.S. House primaries between 2008 and 2016. The results show that working class candidates received an average vote share 24 percentage points lower than nonworkers and are 31 percentage points less likely to win their primaries. Controlling for other candidate, contest, and district characteristics helps to attenuate the performance gap. We find mixed evidence that fundraising and prior officeholding experience moderates workers' performance, but weak or no evidence that voter bias, party affiliation, or primary type do so. The study suggests that workers struggle to compete in primaries and calls for further research explaining what prevents workers from winning public office.

",Timothy J. Hoellein,"Loren Hou. First author, a LUC undergraduate (Biology) and MS graduate (Biology)",,Article,"1. Microplastics (particles <5 mm) are commonly found in aquatic organisms across taxonomic groups and ecosystems. However, the egestion rate of microplastics from aquatic organisms and how egestion rates compare to other rates of microplastic movement in the environment are sparsely documented.
2. We fed microplastic fibres to round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus), an abundant, invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We conducted two trials where round gobies were fed microplastic-containing food either a single time (1 day) or every day over 7 days.
3. There was no difference in microplastic egestion rates from the 1 day or 7 day feeding trials, suggesting no impact of duration of exposure on egestion (exponential decay rate = −0.055 [±0.016 SE] and −0.040 [±0.007 SE], respectively). Turnover time of microplastics (i.e., average time from ingestion to egestion) in the gut ranged from 18.2 to 25.0 hr, similar to published values for other freshwater taxa.
4. We also measured microplastics in the digestive tracts of round gobies collected directly from Lake Michigan, U.S.A. Using published values for round goby density and microplastic concentration at the study sites, we calculated areal egestion rate by round gobies (no. particles m–2 day–1), and compared it to riverine microplastic export (no. particles m–2 day–1). Both area-based rates were of the same order of magnitude, suggesting that round goby egestion could be an important, and potentially overlooked component of microplastic dynamics at the ecosystem scale.
5. Animal egestion is well-known as a major component of nutrient and carbon cycling. However, direct measurements of microplastic fluxes in the environment that include animal egestion rates are uncommon. An ecosystem ecology approach is needed to meet the emerging challenge of generating microplastic budgets for freshwater environments and elsewhere, thereby informing management and mitigation of plastic pollution at a global scale.",Biology,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99213984143502506&context=L&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,DOI: 10.1111/fwb.14007,Wiley,"Hou, L., McNeish, R., & Hoellein, T.

The state of Illinois (USA) is a critical region for understanding the threats of AIS because it possesses the only continuous aquatic habitat connecting the Laurentian Great Lakes and Mississippi River Basins. In this study, we update a previous effort to catalogue and evaluate historical AIS records from Illinois. Our updated database shows that there are now at least 92 nonindigenous aquatic species established in Illinois and a further 51 have been recorded as introduced but not established. This is more species than reported in the earlier database, most likely due to improved access to data and a longer timeframe of analysis. Rates of introduction and establishment have continued to increase in Illinois over the past century, and we identify new groups of organisms that were not in the previous database. Current sampling efforts are not sufficient to detect the number of invaders present and additional non-native species may be present but not yet recorded. Illinois is likely to remain an important hub for the introduction and spread of invasive aquatic species with implications for freshwater ecosystems across the continent.","Life sciences; Ecology; Developmental biology; Botany; Introduced organisms

Kelly,,2023-03-29,Article,"Learning in asynchronous online environments has gained importance over the last several decades, and educational environment shifts from the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have increased this need. Science educators and students need information about which approaches work in the asynchronous environment where informal feedback tends to be reduced, compared to other teaching modalities. In this study, we asynchronously implemented a learning module across 5 institutions that guided students (N = 199) from prescriptive data analysis through guided inquiry and eventually to open inquiry. The module focuses on the science behind climate change. Students work with the same authentic data sets used by professional scientists to examine geologic history and causes of climate change. By analyzing contemporary atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature data and then using the 800,000-year record available from the Vostok ice core proxy record of atmospheric properties, students identify the causes of climate change and discover the unprecedented nature of recent atmospheric changes. Using a pre/post-module assessment, we demonstrate improvement in students’ understanding of climate change processes and statistical methods used to analyze data. However, there was no evidence that the module develops students’ scientific reasoning about the relationship between causation and correlation. Students maintained that correlation is not causation, even when a robust causal mechanism (i.e., the greenhouse effect) explains the link between atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature. Finally, our analysis indicated that generally, anxiety about climate change was reduced during the module, such that students become less anxious about the climate change the more they learn about it. However, science-denying students experienced much higher anxiety about climate change than students who accepted the scientific consensus about climate change. Climate science-dissenting students were so few in this study that a statistical comparison was not possible, but this intriguing finding warrants further investigation of the role of anxiety in science denial. Mainly, this study demonstrates how asynchronous online learning environments can indeed support the achievement of learning objectives related to conducting authentic science, such as increasing understanding of climate change and statistical concepts, all while not provoking anxiety about climate change.",Climate change education; Asynchronous; Quantitative literacy; Climate change anxiety,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2023.2193810,DOI: 10.1080/10899995.2023.2193810,Taylor & Francis,"Meixner, T., Ciancarelli, B., Farrell, E.

While schools can be an optimal location for mental health support, school psychologists often have to work with clinical providers given the increases in youth mental health needs and the shortage of school-based providers. This study used an online survey with a mixed-methods approach to understand the collaboration practices of school and clinical psychologists. A sample of 57 practitioners in the United States were asked to provide their perceptions of the roles of their interagency providers, their collaboration practices, and the benefits or barriers in the collaboration process. Findings indicated differences in providers’ perceptions of the quality of assessments conducted and the importance of particular psychological practices to the roles of clinical and school psychologists. Content analysis of open-ended responses found that while providers acknowledge the benefits of collaboration there was distrust among providers.

As automation, robotization, and digitization continues to accelerate and drive new patterns of economic change, so does the need for proactive programs and policies aimed at targeted workforce re-training. Applying machine learning (ML) to occupational data provides one potential approach to inform such workforce initiatives, specifically by helping to predict both declining and growing occupations with advanced accuracy. In this paper, we examine the extent to which occupational attributes are predictive of the declining and growing status of jobs in the State of Ohio (USA). In particular, we examine the results from five distinct supervised ML models (i.e., multinomial logistic regression, nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting), and data on the characteristics of occupations from O*NET, as well as information on employment changes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. We found that the random forest and gradient boosting models perform the best, predicting declining and growing jobs in Ohio at roughly 92% accuracy in the test set. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the most important features in predicting declining occupations are physical (e.g., spending time making repetitive motions), while the most important features in predicting growing occupations are related to obtaining information and communication. Our method can be replicated at a local or regional level to help practitioners predict future occupational shifts, ultimately enhancing economic and workforce development efforts.",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-023-00211-0,DOI: 10.1007/s42001-023-00211-0,Springer International Publishing,"Khalaf, C., Michaud, G., & Jolley, G.

A significant health challenge is evident in the United States, with 6 in 10 adults having a chronic disease and 4 in 10 adults having 2 or more. Chronic disease self-management aims to prevent or delay disease progression and disability and reduce mortality risk. The evidence to support the use of information technology tools, including mobile apps, web-based portals, and web-based educational interventions, that support disease self-management and improve clinical outcomes is growing. Customer discovery and value proposition design methodology is a form of stakeholder engagement and is based on marketing and lean start-up business methods. As applied in health care, customer discovery and value proposition methodology can be used to understand the clinical problem and articulate the product’s hypothesized unique value proposition relative to alternative options that are available to end users.
Objective:
This study aims to describe the experience and findings of academic researchers applying the customer discovery and value proposition methodology to identify stakeholders, needs, adaptability, and sustainability of a chronic disease self-management mobile app (CDapp). The motivation of the work is to make mobile health app interventions accessible and acceptable for all segments of patients’ chronic diseases.
Methods:
Data were obtained through key informant interviews and analyzed using rapid qualitative analysis techniques. The value proposition framework was used to build the interview guide. The aim was to identify the needs, challenges (pains), and potential benefits (gains) of the CDapp for our stakeholders.
Results:
Our results showed that the primary consumers (end users) of a CDapp were the patients. The app adopters (decision makers) can be medical center leaders including population health department managers or insurance providers, while the consumer adoption influencers (influencers or saboteurs) are clinicians and patient caregivers. We developed an ecosystem map to visualize the clinical practice workflow and how an app for chronic disease management might integrate within an academic health care center or system. A value proposition for the identified customer segments was generated. Each stakeholder segment was working within a different framework to improve patient self-management. Patients needed help to adhere to self-care activities and they needed tailored health education. Health care leaders aim to improve the quality of care while reducing costs and workload. Clinicians wanted to improve patient education and care while reducing the time burden. Our results also showed that within academic medical centers, there were variations regarding patients’ self-reported abilities to manage their diseases.
Conclusions:
Customer discovery is a useful form of stakeholder engagement when designing studies that seek to implement, adapt, and sustain an intervention. The customer discovery and value proposition methodology can be used as an alternative or complementary approach to formative research to generate valuable information in a brief period.",Hypertension; Caregivers; Life skills; Disease management; Health education,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_85959d59ed254fdf9cced4f3dfed61e8&context=PC&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,DOI: 10.2196/50334,"

",Paul K. Moser,,2023-10-13,Article,"God has something to prove to humans, but they typically overlook this. They often ask what they can prove about God, but they rarely ask what God aims to prove to or about them. This striking omission calls for correction, for the sake of responsible inquiry about God. The correction offered here will explain that the answer to the question of what God aims to prove determines the answer to the question of what humans are able to prove about God. The needed correction will arise in the light of a recurring but underappreciated biblical theme about what God proves, or vindicates, in the presence of human distrust, avoidance, and alienation toward God. God aims to prove that God alone is perfectly righteous but nonetheless can justify initially resistant people who cooperate in a re-creative process. The process is that of making them worthy of God and God's good news of unmerited divine approval for humans. This perspective has been widely neglected by theologians, biblical interpreters, and philosophers of religion. Restoring attention to it will help to make some sense of God's ways in the world, thereby adding credibility to those ways and to faith in God.

The hypothesis is that No-self can function as an instrument of counter-induction, that is, an alternative conceptual scheme that exposes by contrast the intuitive or ""folk"" theoretical presuppositions sedimented in our perception of ourselves and others. When incorporated into regimens of meditative and ritual practice, the No-self doctrine works to challenge and disrupt our naïve folk psychology. The author argues that there is a fruitful parallel between the No-self doctrine and anti-Cartesian trends in the cognitive sciences. The No-self doctrine was the product of philosophical speculation undertaken in the context of hegemonic struggles with both Buddhist and non-Buddhist rivals, and the classic No-self doctrine, accordingly, is a somewhat schematic and largely accidental anticipation of the current scientific understanding of the mind and consciousness. Nevertheless, inasmuch as it challenges and unsettles the seemingly self-evident certitudes of folk psychology, it prepares the ground for the revolution in our self-conception promised by the emerging cognitive scientific concept of mind.

 In the face of ecological catastrophe, neither feminists nor environmentalists have the option of merely supporting an environmental politics that would preserve an imagined nature somewhere outside capitalism. As Johanna Oksala contends, the political goal must be more radical: to challenge the capitalist economic system itself and the mechanisms by which it expropriates life on the planet.
 Feminism, Capitalism, and Ecology lays the critical groundwork for this political project. It develops a new way of bringing feminist and ecological responses to capitalism together into a cohesive framework. By exposing the systemic logic by which environmental destruction and gender oppression are jointly rooted in capitalism, Oksala establishes the theoretical foundations for an effective political alliance. The traditions of materialist ecofeminism and Marxist feminism are critical starting points. But the rapid rise of biotechnology and the steady increase of precarity necessitate a model of resistance that responds to the distinctive challenges of contemporary biocapitalism. Timely and urgent, this book articulates a theoretically sophisticated response and maps out our real-world options in this existential struggle.","Ecofeminism; Philosophy, Marxist",,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99214026350202506&context=L&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISBN: 9780810146105,Northwestern University Press,"Oksala, J.

",Fares Qeadan; William A. Barbeau,Sydney Ross,2023-11-15,Article,"Introduction:
This study examines factors associated with psychostimulant misuse, including polysubstance use and social factors, among the understudied American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian (AI/AN/NH) college student population.
Methods:
Data were from the 2015 to 2019 American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment IIc (ACHA-NCHA IIc) survey. Multivariable logistic regression models and odds ratios were used to estimate associations between psychostimulant misuse and potential risk and protective factors among AI/AN/NH college students, including licit and illicit substance use, social support, relationship factors, exposure to violence or abuse, mental health symptoms, drug and alcohol education, and sample demographics.
Results:
Opioid misuse among AI/AN/NH college students significantly increased the odds of using psychostimulants. Specifically, for cocaine use, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 3.17 with a 95% confidence interval (C.I.) of 2.17 to 4.63; for methamphetamine use, the aOR was 38.87 (95% C.I. 19.24-78.52). For amphetamine misuse among non-Tobacco users, the aOR was 5.47 (95% C.I. 3.49-8.55), while among Tobacco users, the aOR was 2.65 (95% C.I. 2.07-3.41). For cocaine and other stimulant misuse, the aOR was 3.64 (95% C.I. 2.30-5.67). Additionally, the use of other types of licit and illicit substances was associated with greater odds of psychostimulant use and misuse. Conversely, factors such as age, living on campus, and residing in parental/guardian housing were linked with lower odds of psychostimulant use and misuse.
Conclusion:
Substance use prevention and treatment interventions targeting AI/AN/NH college students should address polysubstance use, including the combined use of opioids and psychostimulants. Substance use interventions should not be siloed to focus narrowly on single substances but rather should leverage potential protective factors against substance use, such as promoting supportive campus and family living conditions and other social support networks, in broad efforts to reduce multiple forms of substance use among AI/AN/NH students.","Cocaine; College students; Drug abuse; Drug utilization; Drug use

Samar,,2023,Article,"The Supreme Court’s anti-abortion opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org., which overruled Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of S.E. Penn. v. Casey, on the one hand suggests that the Court may be moving toward eliminating all non-enumerated fundamental rights not deeply rooted in the Nation’s longstanding history and tradition. On the other hand, it may suggest only that the Court might be just opening the door to overruling specific non-enumerated rights with which it no longer agrees. Either way, many long-recognized, non-enumerated, human rights, beyond abortion that are essential to individual autonomy and human dignity are now up for grabs. Such rights in the area of privacy law will most likely include not just abortion, but also contraception, interracial marriage, and the Court’s more recent recognition of same-sex marriage, and possibly still other precedents, including whether states can criminalize adult consensual same-sex behavior in private. More importantly, the proposed foundation for this Court’s potential departure from its past case precedents cannot be justified even by claiming such rights are not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition. As I hope to show in this article, neither from the point of view of looking to this Nation’s longstanding history and traditions, if properly understood, nor from the point of view of allowing Equal Protection to aid in identifying forms of discrimination not previously recognized or afforded much attention, can departures from past human rights precedents based in autonomy be justified.",Public interest law -- United States; Civil law -- United States; Civil law; Public interest law; United States,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99213411966302506&context=L&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISSN : 1932-2046,University of Connecticut School of Law,"Limiting Fundamental Rights to Only Those Founded Upon Longstanding Tradition Undermines the Court's Legitimacy and Disavows Individual Human Dignity, 22 Connecticut Public Interest Law Journal 1-54 (2023)",,record,eng,,

Generally, physicians have the freedom to decide how to communicate this information, and to tailor their disclosures to the needs of individual patients. However, in today’s highly politicized climate, some state legislatures areeliminating this opportunity for professional discretion. Physicians are increasingly being compelled to communicate statemandated messaging that may be at odds with their professional judgment, violating their ethical duty to secure informed consent by ""present[ing] relevant information accurately and sensitively, inkeepingwith the patient’s preferences for receiving medical information.""1 Even though physicians and patient advocates have argued that these targeted disclosure laws are unconstitutional, the FirstAmendment sets few restrictions on the government’s ability to compel physician speech.

Melstrom, Rowan Obach; Paulina Vaca; Sydney Durkin; Frances Rafferty;,2023-04-12,Article,"Environmental contamination and limited access to green spaces disproportionately burden communities of color with negative impacts on residents' health. Yet, cleaning up contamination and creating green spaces has in some cases been associated with displacing long-term residents as the neighborhood becomes desirable to more affluent, often Whiter, populations through environmental gentrification. We used mixed methods to investigate environmental gentrification in the city of Chicago, IL, USA. We examined quantitatively the relationship between green areas, brownfield cleanups, and indicators of gentrification, including race and ethnicity, income, households without children, and home ownership. We explored through qualitative interviews how key informants perceive the risk and impacts of environmental gentrification. We found that brownfields cleanup is statistically correlated with proportionately fewer Hispanic residents and more White residents. We did not find any significant correlation between green area and demographic change with the exception of an elevated rail trail linear park. These results align with a racialized process of gentrification, described by some key informants, whereby racial stereotypes lead White newcomers to feel more comfortable moving into Hispanic than Black neighborhoods. The interview results also suggested that racialized disinvestment drives the displacement of people of color, especially African-Americans, from their communities and serves as a precursor for gentrification. These results add to a growing body of evidence that interventions to prevent environmental gentrification will need to be context-specific, multi-faceted, equity-centered, and ideally occur early on within disinvested communities before gentrification takes hold.",Disinvestment; Displacement; Environmental justice,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_landurbplan_2023_104765&context=PC&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104765,Elsevier,"Schusler, T.

coll042,shuffelton.png,,,Collaboration: Philosophy of Education in Practice,Amy B. Shuffelton,,2023-11-16,Book,"Collaboration is widely celebrated as an ability schools should teach children to practice. Yet collaboration has a darker side, as its use to refer to those complicit with Nazi occupiers and with colonial oppressors of many kinds suggests. In effect, ""collaboration"" is a contranym, a word that can mean something or its opposite. To collaborate can mean to work with one's friends and colleagues for the common good. It can also mean to sell out one's friends and colleagues for the sake of personal gain. What can schools do to encourage the first and discourage the second? The loyalty and commitment to shared ends that collaboration implies may seem a positive good only insofar as those loyalties and ends are also good – but how to judge? This book asks: to whom should one be loyal and what are the limits of loyalty? What responsibility do collaborators bear for the outcomes of their joint projects? Should I make those friends and those responsibilities my own? These are questions children learn to answer in schools, through the formal and informal education that happens there. Amy Shuffelton explores those questions in the context of children's lives in schools, including examples from films, literature, and children's own accounts of moral dilemmas they face around questions of friendship, authority, and their own developing agency. She argues that rather than collaboration being a simple, good practice, considerable care is needed to ensure it serves individuals and their communities well.",Education -- Philosophy;Cooperativeness -- Study and teaching,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99214071752802506&context=L&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISBN: 9781350302747,Bloomsbury Academic,"Shuffelton, A.

But for a group of kids, the occasion is a chance to escape the gaze of adults. Dio, a younger, slightly nerdy boy, peels himself away from the festivals and his mother, wanting to play with older boy Flaco. Together the two join the rest of the neighborhood kids.The kids ride bikes in abandoned buildings, carousing and horsing around. It's exhilarating and fun, full of adventure and freedom for Flaco and his loyal sidekick. But when the game turns into a pretend war, Dio discovers he may be in over his head. Directed and written by Miguel Silveira, this short drama captures the joy and freedom of childhood, in a loose, free-form visual style that's as restless and energetic as the kids themselves. And with its almost documentary-like attention to the parade as a neighborhood event, full of military pageantry and community, it's also a powerful portrait of community, one joined together by location and culture and complicated by what it takes to belong safely to these communities.",,,,,https://youtu.be/_Emhbnbuv9o?feature=shared,https://youtu.be/_Emhbnbuv9o?feature=shared,,,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,eng,,

Consistent with self‐determination theory (SDT) of motivation, trajectories of amotivation, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation were modeled. Methods The study included a robust multi‐method, multi‐source assessment of academic outcomes, including homework performance ratings; reading and mathematics standardized test scores; and grade point average (GPA) obtained from school records. Participants included 302 adolescents (ages 12–14; Mage = 13.20) in eighth grade who were specifically recruited so that approximately half (n = 162) were diagnosed with ADHD and 140 adolescents comprising a comparison sample without ADHD. The sample was predominantly White (81.80%), with 7.90% identifying as bi/multiracial, 5.30% identifying as Black/African American, 4.60% identifying as Asian, and 0.30% identifying as Indigenous/Alaskan. Results Adolescents with ADHD had worse academic motivation at all timepoints. Growth curve analyses indicated the academic motivation of adolescents without ADHD decreased at faster rates across the transition to high school compared to adolescents with ADHD. However, for adolescents with ADHD, amotivation, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation each predicted GPA, with higher extrinsic and intrinsic motivation also predicting better homework performance and different aspects of math performance, whereas for youth without ADHD, only amotivation and extrinsic motivation predicted GPA.

All studies were conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia and were published in English. The most common manifestation of the relationship between water insecurity and gender‐based violence was an increased risk of sexual and physical violence for women who walked long distances to access water. This was followed by intimate partner violence sparked by the inability to meet domestic obligations due to household water inadequacy. Despite these trends, the domains of water insecurity, and the types of violence experienced by women, were often intertwined. We conclude that there is a dearth of information assessing gender‐based violence and water insecurity, especially in Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia, and involving locally‐based scholars. We suggest that the spectrum of what is considered ""violence"" in relation to water insecurity be expanded and that scholars and practitioners adopt the term ""gender‐based water violence"" to describe water‐related stressors that are so extreme as to threaten human health and well‐being, particularly that of women and girls. Finally, we encourage the development of cross‐culturally validated measures of gender‐based violence, which can be deployed in conjunction with standardized measures of water insecurity, to evaluate interventions that target these linked threats to global health.

In this work, we derive the generalization of the Larmor formula for fermion pair radiation. We focus on the case of a point-like classical source in an elliptical orbit that emits fermions through vector and scalar mediators. Ultra-light fermion emission from such systems becomes relevant when the mass of the mediator is larger than the frequency of the periodic motion. This enables us to probe regions of the parameter space that are inaccessible in on-shell bosonic radiation. We apply our results to pulsar binaries with mediators that couple to muons and neutrinos.

To test this hypothesis, we made transcriptome prediction models for use in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) using different methods (elastic net, joint-tissue imputation [JTI], matrix expression quantitative trait loci [Matrix eQTL], multivariate adaptive shrinkage in R [MASHR], and transcriptome-integrated genetic association resource [TIGAR]) and tested their out-of-sample transcriptome prediction accuracy in population-matched and cross-population scenarios. Additionally, to evaluate model applicability in TWASs, we integrated publicly available multiethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study and Pan-ancestry genetic analysis of the UK Biobank (PanUKBB) with our developed transcriptome prediction models. In regard to transcriptome prediction accuracy, MASHR models performed better or the same as other methods in both population-matched and cross-population transcriptome predictions. Furthermore, in multiethnic TWASs, MASHR models yielded more discoveries that replicate in both PAGE and PanUKBB across all methods analyzed, including loci previously mapped in GWASs and loci previously not found in GWASs. Overall, our study demonstrates the importance of using methods that benefit from different populations’ effect size estimates in order to improve TWASs for multiethnic or underrepresented populations. We built transcriptome prediction models that leverage effect size estimates across different populations using multivariate adaptive shrinkage and showed that they performed better or the same as other methods in both population-matched and cross-population predictions.

After summarizing the debate on how to characterize exchanges between ""ordinary Italians"" and the Fascist regime, this chapter looks at a particular category of women; those who had lost sons or husbands in the First World War, to examine how they understood their roles in the public sphere and the degree to which that understanding conformed to the expectations placed upon them. The idealized ""Mothers and Widows of the Fallen"" formed a crucial, much-manipulated symbolic component of Fascist mythology. They filled key roles in Fascist rituals and provided a recurring motif in Fascist propaganda. Images of their bodies were managed, displayed, ""nationalized"" to exemplify silent, sacrificing womanhood. To this silence, Fascist ideologues attributed wholehearted consent for the regime and its projects. However, despite the regime’s sustained efforts to reduce such women to symbols, war mothers and widows maintained views of themselves rooted in multiple discourses and experiences. Moreover, many of them strategically adopted the regime’s rhetoric to claim agency and advocate on behalf of themselves and others. This focus on a group of women who were constitutive elements as well as recipients of the regime’s propaganda provides a unique perspective from which to consider the political communication of the regime and the ways in which that communication was consumed, understood, and sometimes repurposed by subaltern actors.",Political participation;Representative government and representation;Political science -- Philosophy;World politics -- 19th century,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99214071752602506&context=L&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISBN: 9781003290087,Routledge,"Wingenter, A.

coll054,ye.jpeg,,,Improving focality and consistency in micromagnetic stimulation,Hui Ye,,2023-02-17,Article,"The novel micromagnetic stimulation (μMS) technology aims to provide high resolution on neuronal targets. However, consistency of neural activation could be compromised by a lack of surgical accuracy, biological variation, and human errors in operation. We have recently modeled the activation of an unmyelinated axon by a circular micro-coil. Although the coil could activate the axon, its performance sometimes lacked focality and consistency. The site of axonal activation could shift by several experimental factors, including the reversal of the coil current, displacement of the coil, and changes in the intensity of the stimulation. Current clinical practice with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has suggested that figure-eight coils could provide better performance in magnetic stimulation than circular coils. Here, we estimate the performance of μMS by a figure-eight micro-coil, by exploring the impact of the same experimental factors on its focality and consistency in axonal activation. We derived the analytical expression of the electric field and activating function generated by the figure-eight micro-coil, and estimated the location of axonal activation. Using NEURON modeling of an unmyelinated axon, we found two different types (A and B) of axon activation by the figure-eight micro-coil, mediated by coil currents of reversed direction. Type A activation is triggered by membrane hyperpolarization followed by depolarization; Type B activation is triggered by direct membrane depolarization. Consequently, the two types of stimulation are governed by distinct ion channel mechanisms. In comparison to the circular micro-coil, the figure-eight micro-coil requires significantly less current for axonal activation. Under figure-eight micro-coil stimulation, the site of axonal activation does not change with the reversal of the coil current, displacement of the coil, or changes in the intensity of the stimulation. Ultimately, the figure-eight micro-coil provides a more efficient and consistent site of activation than the circular micro-coil in μMS.",Magnetic brain stimulation;Neurons;Membrane Potentials;Magnetic fields,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_526d0f4a6aba4d5ab3872b5fda6dbbda&context=PC&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,DOI: 10.3389/fncom.2023.1105505,Frontiers Research Foundation,"Ye, H., Hall, V., & Hendee, J.

Yet relatively little is known about how anti-Asian content on social media, as well as positive messages to combat the hate, have varied over time. In this study, we investigated temporal changes in the frequency of anti-Asian and counter-hate messages on Twitter during the first 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the Twitter Data Collection Application Programming Interface, we queried all tweets from January 30, 2020 to April 30, 2021 that contained specific anti-Asian (e.g., #chinavirus, #kungflu) and counter-hate (e.g., #hateisavirus) keywords. From this initial data set, we extracted a random subset of 1,000 Twitter users who had used one or more anti-Asian or counter-hate keywords. For each of these users, we calculated the total number of anti-Asian and counter-hate keywords posted each month. Latent growth curve analysis revealed that the frequency of anti-Asian keywords fluctuated over time in a curvilinear pattern, increasing steadily in the early months and then decreasing in the later months of our data collection. In contrast, the frequency of counter-hate keywords remained low for several months and then increased in a linear manner. Significant between-user variability in both anti-Asian and counter-hate content was observed, highlighting individual differences in the generation of hate and counter-hate messages within our sample.

First, in the mid-1960s, Black youth responded to repressive political and socioeconomic factors in West Oakland by founding the Black Panther Party for Self Defense, whose representation of violence and community aid, as well as its radical and militant approach to Black Nationalism, became a foundational discourse that shaped the development of rap music in the region. Second, from the collapse of the Party in the early 1980s through the 1990s, gangster rap emerged as a form of political expression among local youth, who drew heavily on radical and militant elements of Panther discourse in their lyrics and artwork. Third, hyphy music in themid-1990s to early 2000s continued these radical discourses and also incorporated coordinated, subversive public behavior to the mix. The result was a critique of endemic problems facing the local Black community, but also an infectious subgenre of party music that gained mainstream popularity. Overall, this study shows that the specific types of representation created to resist problems of racism and poverty in Oakland is actually key to understanding other rap undergrounds, grassroots subcultures, and social movements elsewhere. In the process, Rap and Politics offers readers a new model focused on the development of settings, representation, movements, discourse banks, and impact within underground rap scenes.",Black Panther Party -- History;Rap (Music) -- Political aspects -- California -- Oakland;Music and race -- California -- Oakland -- History -- 20th century;Black power -- California -- Oakland -- History -- 20th century,,,,https://luc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma99213821617702506&context=L&vid=01LUC_INST:01LUC&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&lang=en,ISBN: 9781137600110,Palgrave Macmillan,"Pope, L.

It may come as a surprise, then, to learn that the field has yet to be established. Instead, efforts to understand the place of housing in society have been largely subsumed within other disciplines, such as economics and urban planning. Over time, it has only become clearer how central a role housing plays in structuring our lives, from long-standing discriminatory lending practices that determine who can own a home and where, to unequal eviction practices, on up to the 2008 financial crisis and the decimation of the American housing market. With the collection of essays in this book, the editors and contributors propose to solidify the place of housing studies as a distinct subfield within the discipline of sociology, showing that housing is both an important element of multiple sociological subfields and a significant component of social life deserving of dedicated attention as a distinct area of research.

This book explores their experiences, listening carefully to what they have to say, how they--you!--respond to poetry, why you love it. The book shows, in other words, at least a partial cure for that falling interest in the humanities which gets so much attention in newspapers and on TV.

En el primero de esta nueva serie, Silvia Dolinko examina un aguafuerte de Luis Felipe (Yuyo) Noé reproducido junto con una tarjeta de saludo de fin de año impresa por la Galería Bonino (sede Nueva York) en 1966. Estos documentos gráficos que produce la galería forman parte de su proyecto artístico y de su estrategia comercial. En este caso particular, el aguafuerte fue creado por Noé en su estancia en Nueva York, al calor de su vínculo con el New York Graphic Workshop y los artistas que allí trabajaban, en la vanguardia del grabado. La cualidad de este tipo de impresión, que permite la multiplicación de ejemplares, se enriquece al comparar dos de ellos, el que se encuentra resguardado en Espigas con el de la colección del Museo Nacional del Grabado. Este último conserva solo el aguafuerte; en Espigas, en cambio, aguafuerte y tarjeta están asociados, enfatizando la relación entre documento y obra. Con acento en estos últimos términos, Catalina Fara aborda otro tipo de objeto gráfico de interés, el menú de un banquete celebrado en honor al artista Mario Canale con motivo de su primera exposición de grabados. Un documento que combina, en su cualidad de ephemera, aspectos culturales, técnicos y estéticos a la vez que exhibe la sociabilidad artística del momento. Estos dispositivos gráficos, de interés múltiple, se distinguen como documentos, pero también como objetos visuales y de diseño, y encierran cuestiones a investigar acerca de sus funciones y consumo. El caso del menú estudiado es además huella de un acto o momento específico, posible de seguir por las intervenciones, firmas o dibujos que exhibe de los asistentes al banquete.
Por su parte, Caroline Olivia Wolf analiza los catálogos de la Galería Witcomb de 1934, 1937 y 1941 de tres exhibiciones de la artista argentinolibanesa Bibí Zogbé, los que son estudiados en sus aspectos modernistas, pero también con el foco puesto en Zogbé como artista migrante. Como otras mujeres artistas, su recepción crítica fue a menudo estereotipada, desestimando su trabajo como ""pintora de flores"", pero Wolf lee su obra a través de estos catálogos en clave transnacional y feminista, pensando los sentidos sociales, políticos y culturales de las diásporas.
Agradecemos especialmente a la Fundación Banco Santander y al Programa de Promoción Cultural - Mecenazgo del Gobierno de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires por el apoyo en la realización de esta publicación. / Once more, the Centro de Estudios Espigas (Escuela de Arte y Patrimonio, UNSAM), together with Fundación Espigas and Centro de Investigaciones en Arte y Patrimonio (CONICET - Escuela de Arte y Patrimonio, UNSAM), is pleased to make available three short essays that analyze select archival documents held in Espigas’ collections.
In the first text, Silvia Dolinko examines an etching by Luis Felipe Noé (Yuyo), issued along with a Christmas greeting card printed by Bonino Gallery (New York) in 1966. These graphic documents play a part in the gallery’s artistic project and commercial strategy. In this particular case, Noé created the etching during his stay in New York, at the height of his collaboration with the artists at the New York Graphic Workshop, which was at the cutting edge of engraving practices at the time. The print’s characteristics—which allow for unlimited replicas—are revealed when comparing two copies: the one held by Espigas and the one in the Museo Nacional del Grabado. While the latter consists only of the etching, the version in Espigas is composed of both the etching and the greeting card, foregrounding the link between artwork and document. Focusing on these concepts, Catalina Fara addresses another form of relevant graphic object: the menu for the banquet held in honor of artist Mario Canale to celebrate his first etching exhibition. Due to its nature as ephemera, the menu combines cultural, technical, and aesthetic elements and demonstrates the social affairs of the artistic community at the time. These graphic devices—relevant in many fields—are documents and visual and designed objects. They entail aspects related to function and consumption that are worth exploring. Furthermore, the menu at hand marks a specific moment, a time to be traced through the interventions, signatures, or drawings by the banquet’s attendees.
For her contribution, Caroline ""Olivia"" Wolf analyzes Witcomb Gallery catalogs from 1934, 1937, and 1941, all three of which are dedicated to exhibitions of the Argentine-Lebanese artist Bibí Zogbé. The study focuses on the catalogs’ modernist nature but also highlights Zogbé as a migrant artist. Like many other female artists, her critical reception was many times stereotyped, and her work remained underestimated as ""floral painting."" Instead, Wolf interprets her work through these catalogs in terms of transnationalism and feminism, considering the social, political, and cultural meanings of diasporas.

coll066,,,,"More than a Man, Less than a Painter: David Smith in the Popular Press, 1938–1966",Paula Wisotzki,,2023-07-12,Article,"Media coverage was vital in establishing the popular reputation of the Abstract Expressionists. Reporting regularly relied on photographic portraits to present these artists as modernist innovators who were an extension of (or even a replacement for) the work of art. Jackson Pollock came to epitomize the Abstract Expressionist artist, with ""action"" photographs capturing his radical painting method. Pollock’s contemporary, American sculptor David Smith, similarly transformed his medium—in his case by embracing industrial methods to make three-dimensional objects. However, given the constraints inherent in the process of welding he employed, how could Smith’s image be reconstituted as a celebration of artistic individuality so crucial to modernism? The very method Smith embraced to push the boundaries of art kept him from representing the genius creator who channeled the forces of nature to produce culture. By tracing photographs documenting his career published in local and regional newspapers, popular magazines from Popular Science to Life, and mass art magazines from Magazine of Art to Arts, this paper demonstrates that images of Smith at work as an anonymous industrial worker enveloped in protective gear were regularly balanced with images of contemplation—the traditional image of the artist as mediating intelligence. Yet, over the years of his career, the problem of representing Smith was addressed somewhat differently. Early on, there was a tendency to show Smith applying his novel art-making techniques to the production of more traditional objects. During World War II, when Smith was employed as a commercial welder, Smith the artist legitimized reporting on Smith the worker. Finally, in the post-war world—as Smith benefited from the burst of publicity surrounding the triumph of Abstract Expressionism—his rigorous manipulation of metal was celebrated as masculine display, effectively shifting attention away from common industrial labor to heroic individual struggle.",,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/arts12040153,DOI: 10.3390/arts12040153,MDPI,"Wisotzki, P.

They synthesize and generalize empirical findings on the relationships between marketing systems (MS) and quality-of-life (QOL), two concepts integral to macromarketing. Results indicate dimensions of MS are positively associated with QOL, suggesting that marketing systems enhance consumer well-being across contexts and metrics. The promotion dimension of MS has the highest correlation with QOL; the strongest positive MS-QOL relationship was estimated for personal health. Measurement, cultural, and socioeconomic factors that affect the strength of MS-QOL relationships also were assessed. Results suggest the association between MS and QOL is stronger in studies based on primary/subjective measures of QOL constructs, in samples drawn from developed economies, and in more indulgent, uncertainty-tolerant, and long-term-oriented cultures.

",Michael J. Schumacher,,2022-12-22,Article,"This article envisions a new conceptual framework for collective identity among Palestinians and Israelis that can be modeled after congruent religious values. By identifying discreet values through the content analysis of religious scripture, this article argues that a new collective identity can be made, and a collective movement for peace initiated, by reframing and amplifying key religious values that are shared widely in Palestine/Israel. The analysis reveals that the religious centrality of Abraham to Palestinians and Israelis can act as a starting point for situating a transcendent connection between ideologically conflicted group identities. Furthermore, the cultural heritages of alms giving, forgiveness, and repentance can help overcome secular and religious barriers by acting as a key conceptual tool for interfaith dialog and negotiation. And finally, the inviolability of Jerusalem to both groups can be reframed to emphasize sacred space as a constructive mechanism for political and social equality rather than division. The article concludes with a discussion of the practical implications of this framework for grassroots peacemaking as well as the future viability of national partition plans.

There is a myriad of ways in which the guitarist can alter the timbre, depending upon the sound they wish to convey to their audience. The objective of this study is to investigate how the timbre of an acoustic guitar depends on the type of strings used, where the string is excited, and where a capo is placed, if used. The main goal was to determine how these factors play a role in creating sounds for different genres of music, where guitars are one of the main instruments. Specific adjustments can be made by the guitarist that correspond to stylistic distinctions between different styles of music. Using our results, the musicians can create specific effects that enhance the effect of the music on the audience. This paper focuses on how the results justify guitarist’s artistic decisions in flamenco, Irish traditional, and country/folk music.

",Urooj Raja,,2023-12-28,Article,"Virtual reality or VR is a technology that uses computers to generate simulated words. It has been attracting attention lately as, for some, it represents a new frontier in communication, while others are far from convinced. This paper proposes a recasting of VR as a technology for ""care ethics."" It draws on some examples of work in environmental communication and sister disciplines that show that VR has activated empathy and enabled novel perspective-taking when it comes to communicating environmental issues such as ocean acidification or deforestation. The article also includes a discussion of the opposite, or how VR can activate apathy and desensitize others towards the environment. In addition, two new ideas are presented: One is the idea of ⁣⁣environmental wounding or wounds incurred while doing environmental work and how VR could partially help offer some relief. The VIRAL framework, based on care ethics and reimagination, is also proposed. The essay also touches on broader implications for new technologies and how they can be used as tools of care to address environmental and social challenges.

",Brian Ohsowski; Shane C. Lishawa,,2024-03-11,Article,"Two species of clonal Typha [T. latifolia (native) and T. angustifolia (exotic)] hybridize to form the highly invasive, heterotic (high vigor) T. × glauca in North American wetlands leading to increased primary production, litter accumulation, and biodiversity loss. Conservation of T. latifolia has become critical as invasive Typha has overwhelmed wetlands. In the field, Typha taxa identification is difficult due to subtle differences in morphology, and molecular identification is often unfeasible for managers. Furthermore, improved methods to non-destructively estimate Typha biomass is imperative to enhance ecological impact assessments. To address field-based Typha ID limitations, our study developed a predictive model from 14 Typha characters in 7 northern Michigan wetlands to accurately distinguish Typha taxa (n = 33) via linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of molecularly identified specimens. In addition, our study developed a partial least squares regression (PLS) model to predict Typha biomass from field collected measurements (n = 75). Results indicate that two field measurements [Leaf Counts, Longest Leaf] can accurately differentiate the three Typha taxa and advanced-generation hybrids. The LDA model had a 100% correct prediction rate of T. latifolia. The selected PLS biomass prediction model (sqrt[Typha Dry Mass] ~ log[Ramet Area at 30 cm] + Inflorescence Presence + Total Ramet Height + sqrt[Organic Matter Depth]) improved upon existing simple linear regression (SLR) height-to-biomass predictions. The rapid field-based Typha identification and biomass assessment tools presented in this study advance targeted management for regional conservation of T. latifolia and ecological restoration of wetlands impacted by invasive Typha taxa.

",G. Agustin Markarian,,2023-10-26,Article,"This study examines the differential impact of mass shootings on state gun policy restrictions and posits that victims' race and ethnicity plays a pivotal role. Since the 1970s, pro-gun movements have exploited latent racial biases to oppose gun control measures. They frame gun control as prioritizing the protection of racial minorities over the rights and safety of White Americans, creating political resistance. However, when mass shootings affect White communities, perceptions of the primary beneficiaries of gun control temporarily change. Utilizing a 30-year state panel dataset, the study demonstrates that ten White mass shooting fatalities lead to approximately 1–1.5 restrictive state firearm laws on average, while the same number of fatalities among racial and ethnic minorities has a negative but inconsistent effect on state gun restrictions. These findings are robust to a wide range of modeling specifications and when controlling for other victim-level demographic characteristics. Empirical evidence suggests that legislators and gun control interest groups display stronger support for restrictive legislation following mass shootings involving White victims but not racial and ethnic minority victims.

Yet, sociocultural theory highlights the presence of minoritized families’ cultural wealth. Consistent with a focus on assets, it is notable that college enrollment rates have increased among Black and Latino students in the U.S. Using a mixed methods approach, the current study integrated asset and risk frameworks, in order to advance knowledge on the context of minoritized teens’ college preparedness, defined here as making decisions and taking action steps toward college. Participants included low-income, predominantly Black and Latino families with adolescents (n = 344). First, drawing from the voices of families, we examined responses to open-ended questions about aspirations, supports, and challenges. Salient themes included social-emotional and social-cultural factors. Indicators of cumulative contextual risk and cumulative individual risk were based on the qualitative data. Second, we tested whether the linkage from cumulative risk indices to teens’ college preparedness occurred via various dimensions of self-regulation (i.e., lower impulsivity, more cognitive control, and better organization skills), net of background characteristics. Adolescents’ organization skills were a significant mediator. Possible next steps for research are discussed.

coll077,haker.jpg,,,Vulnerability in Times of War: The Necessity of the Moral Third,Hille P. Haker,,2023-11-23,Article,"Vulnerability as a critique of the one-sidedness of the principle of autonomy is at risk of overemphasizing the positive dimension of vulnerability. Moreover, in the discourse on vulnerability, the threat of dehumanization (or moral vulnerability) has not been scrutinized enough ethically. Therefore, the ethics of vulnerability is insufficient when faced with the force of war that requires the conceptualization of vulnerability for political-ethics. The Russian war in Ukraine demonstrates this weakness in a striking way: the called-for openness to the other as well as an active form of nonviolence, as promoted by Judith Butler, may not be an option in times of war. Continuing Jessica Benjamin’s psychoanalytic approach to mutual recognition, the essay shows that the task of morality does not rest upon broadening one’s vulnerability, but rather in understanding vulnerable agency as the dialectic of vulnerability and agency. For the further development of this dialectic, the triadic figuration is emphasized, complementing the dyadic relation of self and other. While the Third can take multiple figurations in the psychoanalytical setting, I understand the Third within the political-ethical context as the possibility of a ""moral world"" of nonviolence and respect. During war, the role of the bystander is to become a witness who, through the process of witnessing, advocacy, diplomacy, and justice, allows for the moral Third to reemerge. Among others, the ethics of vulnerability must spell out the price for the failure of taking on this responsibility, namely the eclipse of morality.

Magic tricks presented as demonstrations and programming assignments elicit wonder and captivate students’ attention, so that students want to understand and replicate the work to show it to friends and family members. Capturing student interest and curiosity motivates them to learn the underlying programming concepts.
Two ""Choose a Number"" programs are shown where the computer is able to identify a user’s choice among many alternatives:
1. Magic Letter: A table of numbers with associated random letters is displayed. Participants make choices and the computer identifies their chosen letter.
2. Number Boxes: The user chooses a secret number, for example the age at which their business becomes successful and is sold. The user indicates which boxes displayed on the screen contain the secret number, and the computer then identifies the number.
Two ""Pick a Card"" varieties are shown, where board pieces represent cards, the user selecting one of them that the computer later identifies:

We characterized 110 urethral specimens from men without urethral symptoms, infections, or inflammation using shotgun metagenomics. Most urethral specimens contain characteristic lactic acid bacteria and Corynebacterium spp. In contrast, several bacteria associated with vaginal dysbiosis were present only in specimens from men who reported vaginal intercourse. Sexual behavior, but not other evaluated behavioral, demographic, or clinical variables, strongly associated with inter-specimen variance in urethral microbiome composition. Thus, the male urethra supports a simple core microbiome that is established independent of sexual exposures but can be re-shaped by vaginal sex. Overall, the results suggest that urogenital microbiology and sexual behavior are inexorably intertwined, and show that the male urethra harbors female urogenital pathobionts.

They thus pose a challenge for thinking about democracy and identity in (anonymous) digital environments: how can we create spaces for marginalized social groups while ensuring the resulting identities remain democratic? While many scholars point to technological affordances or corporate content moderation policies as providing some solutions, in this article I propose a more democratic approach. Drawing from incel wikis and archived forum posts from two early incel communities—IncelSupport and LoveShy—I argue that a community's social norms, and the moderation practices required to sustain them, are user-directed interventions that have outsized effects in shaping group identities in democratic ways.

Do the benefits of strong parties also extend to women’s descriptive representation? We argue that increasing parties’ strength can perpetuate and even intensify parties’ preexisting patterns of exclusion of particular groups, including women, when elites are gender biased. While stronger parties are better able to carry out their organizational goals, we contend that increasing gender equity is often not part of such goals. To evaluate this argument, we combine an exogenous electoral reform that increased parties’ ability to control their members in Brazil with a regression discontinuity design. We find that while the reform increased parties’ ability to pursue their organizational goals, it increased the gap in votes between men and women. Further, we demonstrate that the behavior of men toward women copartisans drives this pattern. These findings highlight the unintended consequences of institutional engineering.

coll083,cornelius.jpg,,,Medieval Manuscripts at Loyola University Chicago,Ian Cornelius; Kathy Young,,2023,Article,"This article provides a summary overview of the collection of pre-1600 western European manuscripts in Loyola University Chicago Archives and Special Collections. The collection presently comprises four manuscript codices, at least 38 fragments, and four documents. The codices are a thirteenth-century Book of Hours from German-speaking lands; a fifteenth-century Dutch prayerbook; a preacher’s compilation written probably in southern Germany in the 1440s; and two fifteenth-century Italian humanist booklets, bound together since the nineteenth century, transmitting Donatus’s commentary on the Eunuchus (incomplete) and an anthology of theological excerpts, respectively. The fragments consist of thirteen leaves from books dismembered by modern booksellers (most are from fifteenth-century Books of Hours) and a larger number of binding fragments, all but two of which remain in situ. These represent the remains of ten manuscript books: four Latin liturgical books, two texts of Roman civil law, one large-format thirteenth-century Italian Bible, one thirteenth-century copy of Ptolemy’s Almagest in the translation of Gerard of Cremona, one late fourteenth-century copy of the Ockhamist Tractatus de principiis theologiae, and one fifteenth-century Dutch Book of Hours in the translation of Geert Grote. Many of these materials have remained unidentified until now.

",Pamela L. Caughie,,2023-01,Article,"This essay asks, when does our effort to avoid offending students interfere with our ability to teach them? Rehearsing conflicts over language and terminology, over who can speak and what can be said, from my four-decade career as a literature professor, critical theorist, and gender scholar, I confront contemporary efforts to censor certain words, to prohibit certain kinds of inquiry, and to limit who can speak about certain subjects by placing recent incidents in relation to previous debates in academia and the public sphere. The university classroom and scholarly peer-reviewed journals have long served as spaces where established viewpoints can be questioned, knowledge can be challenged, and identities can be probed. Increasingly, however, we see classroom curricula under attack, books banned, language policed, and viewpoints prohibited, with teachers, students, and scholars self-censoring as a result. What happens when words are prohibited, and research subjects are deemed off limit, because some fear they may harm fragile young students or readers? Refusing to have that conversation, to allow scholars and teachers to debate controversial positions openly, itself does the harm. Through examples drawn from my teaching and scholarship, and drawing on newspaper editorials and academic publications, I model a means for working through this seeming impasse encapsulated by the title phrase, ""the word that dare not speak its name.""

",M. Tara Casebolt,,2024-02-21,Article,"People with disabilities (PWD) are thought to be low risk for HIV because of social norms regarding disability and sex. However, qualitative studies indicate they are at risk and are not being reached by HIV programs. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted in Haiti in 2016 included HIV biomarker data and disability status. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using a disability severity indicator as the independent variable and HIV infection as the dependent variable. Covariates were selected based on theory and previous studies. Individuals reporting milder disabilities had a higher odds of HIV infection in the crude model (OR:1.65; CI: 1.16-2.34) and those adjusted for demographics (OR:1.73; CI:1.19-2.51) and sexual activity (OR:1.60; CI:1.06-2.42). Those with moderate and more severe disabilities have the same odds of HIV infection as the general population. PWD are HIV-positive and at risk of HIV infection. Based on this, it is essential that HIV education, testing, and treatment programs are inclusive of PWD. Accessible HIV education materials need to be created. HIV testing programs should involve PWD in planning and implementation. Providers of HIV care must be trained regarding the needs of PWD for reproductive healthcare.

This reading informs two important claims of his later projects: that intentional relations are more fundamental than their relata, and that a metaphysical condition irreducible to consciousness or object constitutes the structure of intentionality. I argue that these positions inform key tenets of reversibility, and that a revisionary interpretation of Hegel's absolute offers Merleau-Ponty a model for the principle that individuates the basic conditions of experience. In addition to demonstrating that he was a more assiduous reader of Hegel than many commentators assume, and highlighting some overlooked debts to Hegel, these results show that Merleau-Ponty's later thought inherits significant idealist commitments, which should motivate us to reconsider its standing within post-Kantian philosophical currents.

Mining, socioenvironmental conflicts, and environmental litigation in northern Chile",Maria Akchurin,,2023-09,Article,"With the judicialization of politics and the creation of new environmental institutions, environmental litigation is now an increasingly common dimension of socioenvironmental conflicts. This study examines this pattern in the context of recently created environmental courts in Chile, focusing on lithium and copper mining litigation in the Atacama salt flats of the Antofagasta Region. I argue that while the courts are formally open to a wide variety of legal complaints, community groups face an uphill battle when using legal mobilization strategies due to the underlying political and economic power of the mining industry in northern Chile. Nevertheless, environmental litigation matters for environmental policy implementation because it reveals conflicts over environmental compliance, highlighting gaps between environmental laws on the books and actual practices. In this sense, environmental litigation activates environmental regulations and can provide communities with greater leverage to demand stronger enforcement, even as the long-term implications of judicial rulings for addressing current and past harms remain to be seen.

Singer,,2023,Article,"The significance of youth suicide as a public health concern is underscored by the fact that it is the second-leading cause of death for youth globally. While suicide rates for White groups have declined, there has been a precipitous rise in suicide deaths and suicide-related phenomena in Black youth; rates remain high among Native American/Indigenous youth. Despite these alarming trends, there are very few culturally tailored suicide risk assessment measures or procedures for youth from communities of color. This article attempts to address this gap in the literature by examining the cultural relevancy of currently widely used suicide risk assessment instruments, research on suicide risk factors, and approaches to risk assessment for youth from communities of color. It also notes that researchers and clinicians should consider other, nontraditional but important factors in suicide risk assessment, including stigma, acculturation, and racial socialization, as well as environmental factors like health care infrastructure and exposure to racism and community violence. The article concludes with recommendations for factors that should be considered in suicide risk assessment for youth from communities of color.

However, these are not the only interests for choosing a correctional officer position. The current study draws on a sample of pre-service correctional officers surveyed prior to beginning their jobs (N = 673). In the spirit of the deviant case method, we focus on a subset of our sample who provided problematic motivations for becoming officers (n = 38). Using a thematic analytic approach, we identified five broad themes within this nefariously/disconcertingly motivated sample: use of force, punitive focus, power and control, cavalier ulterior motives, and problematic social boundaries. We theorize, based on prior research, that these individuals could constitute a meaningful minority that may contribute to the detriment of both their organizations and those they are overseeing. Future research should explore this possibility.

Specifically, I examine several symposiums on woman’s suffrage that The Crisis sponsored. The symposia reflect how Black women emphasized their roles as mothers and wives to invoke traditionally gendered discourses, while simultaneously advancing a feminist philosophy that considered the individual as her own entity. This essay complicates previous historical frameworks that have examined Black women’s political activism through ""communitarian"" and ""race first"" principles, by emphasizing individualism as a factor for those who argued that suffrage was a necessary platform through which women could actualize motherhood, challenge sexism, and achieve political and economic self-sufficiency. In so doing, I reveal how Black women’s capacity to enlist various discourses and allies made them extraordinary public intellectuals and ""intersectional"" theorists of American democracy.

A transqueer hermeneutic serves two functions in this article: first, it foregrounds the centrality of movement in the prefix ""trans""; and, second, it emphasizes how this movement queerly manipulates gender and sexual normativity. A transqueer reading of Dangarembga’s novel points to gendered and sexual subversions of the colonial gender binary by arguing that the protagonist, Tambu, queerly reorients herself to and transly negotiates with the physical spaces in which she is placed instead of simply escaping them. Thus, Nervous Conditions quietly delinks from the colonial cisgender heterosexual binary.
